## Getting Started

**1. Setup `pnpm` and install dependencies**

Once you have a Node runtime available, you can use the following commands to activate `pnpm` and install the project's dependencies.

**2. Start the development server**

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev

# You can CTRL+Click on the logged URL, or...
# Open your browser at the relevant URL
# By default, it should be localhost:5173, but you can override the port with a `-p` flag
```
